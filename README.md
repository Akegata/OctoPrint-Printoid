This plugin sends immediate push notifications to your iOS devices running
[OctoPod](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/octopod-for-octoprint/id1412557625?mt=8) once a
print has finished, bed reached target temp, bed cooled down or MMU requires user assistance.
Push notifications when print is finished include a snapshot of the configured camera. If
you have multiple cameras then you can include a snapshot of any of them. Even if the
cameras are not connected to OctoPrint you can still include a snapshot of the camera.

## Setup

Install via the bundled [Plugin Manager](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/Plugin:-Plugin-Manager)
or manually using this URL:

    https://github.com/gdombiak/OctoPrint-OctoPod/archive/master.zip

## Configuration

Once plugin has been installed, go to _Settings_ and under _Plugins_ you will find a new
entry _OctoPod Notifications_. You must complete the field _Notification Server URL_ (use
default value) and optionally complete the field _Snapshot URL_ if you want a snapshot in
the notification. Update Bed and MMU Notifications as needed.

You can test the configuration before saving it by using the _Send test notification_ button.
