This plugin sends immediate push notifications to your Android devices when:
* your print has finished. Notifications include a snapshot of your camera. If you
have multiple cameras then you can include a snapshot of any of them. Even if the
cameras are not connected to OctoPrint you can still make use of them
* bed has cooled down enough so you can remove your print
* bed has warmed up to target temperature for a specified period so you can start
printing knowing that bed's material won't expand anymore

If you are using [Printoid](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fr.yochi76.printoid.phones.premium)

This plugin is based on the plugin made by the developer of [OctoPod](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/octopod-for-octoprint/id1412557625?mt=8)
